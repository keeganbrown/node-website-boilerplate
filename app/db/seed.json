DOM manipulation includes adding or removing elements from the DOM -or- changing attributes of DOM elements (including class names or other attributes). DOM manipulation can even occurr in ways you wouldn't expect -- say if you've got custom analytics event scripting. If you absolutely have to do this kind of evented analytics (it's hard to get away from on a corporate development level) then you can at least defer your tracking events. <a href=\"https://github.com/keeganbrown/ActionDeferr\" title=\"This might help.\" target=\"_blank\">This script I wrote might help</a>. </li>\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\t<li><strong>Prevent scrolling.</strong> <br /> Scrolling the page on most mobile devices (including some tablets) will often prevent all animation from occurring until the scroll stops.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Leverage a little CSS3.</strong> CSS3 animations and transitions can go a long way to making Javascript animations perform like butter on mobile devices. Even if you're still animating with plain 'ol jQuery, the following CSS3 can still help. <br /> \r\n<code> \r\n#box-around-animated-content {\r\n\t-webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0);\r\n\t-moz-transform: translate3d(0,0,0);\r\n\t-ms-transform: translate3d(0,0,0);\r\n\ttransform: translate3d(0,0,0);\r\n}\r\n</code> <br/> Note that you might need to be a little reserved in how you apply this trick. Doing so engages hardware acceleration on the device, which can have some pretty weird side effects on your page. Use it sparingly -- using this trick on <strong>too many</strong> boxes on the page will cause the device to stop hardware acceleration altogether, and your animations will go back to being clunky. This trick works great on iOS devices and newer android devices. Be sure to check your page in older android devices if you use this trick.</li>\r\n</ol>",

The riddle, which has been rehashed as rephrased countless times since it's inception, goes something like this:\n<!--more-->\nUlysses returns home from a voyage ad docks his ship on one side of the river. After disembarking he instructs his crew to dismantle his boat piece by piece, and reassemble the ship at the dock on the other side of the river. The question then, is: at what point is Ulysses' Ship no longer docked on one side of the river, and at what point is it docked in the other side?\n\nAsk this riddle to numerous people, and you're bound to get numerous answers. The answer I've found most satisfying is as follows:\n\nThere is no such thing as Ulysses Ship -- the ship itself is an abstract concept that only exists in the mind of those who consider it. The only reason that Ulysses may claim to own a ship is that there's a relative agreement between the beliefs of people have an idea of what a ship is and how someone might claim to have one. This is the reason that there's no consistent answer to this riddle -- it depends on ones personal beliefs. \n\nMore so -- it illustrates a deeper truth of our human lives. We, as human beings, primarily act upon and with concepts as though they are real things. This is certainly out of optimization of thought and language -- it's easier to say ship than to list the qualities you might find acceptable as a ship. I can't help thinking that these optimizations a have blurred our insight into the deeper, more real description of reality. Perhaps if we take the time to fully understand what these optimizations are hiding, we'll uncover some far more useful facets of reality.",
